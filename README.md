Machine Learning for Cancer Prediction

Here, Multi-class classification has been done among different cancer types namely Breast cancer, Kidney Cancer, Lung Cancer, Prostate Cancer and Colon Cancer. 
Dataset used in this project is collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
All the datas used here represent different gene expression data. 

Flow of our Cancer Genomics Project involves following steps
1. Import required libraries and data
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Explaoratory Data Analysis
4. Feature Engineering
5. Classification
6. Model Evaluation
7. Performance metrices evaluation
